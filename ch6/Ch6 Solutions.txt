6.1 The Heavy Pill:
You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 gram. 
Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle? you can only use the scale once.

Solution:

Here, we can use the scale just once. Since, one of the bottles has pills that are heavier than others, 
we take an increasing number of pills from each bottle. We identify the bottle with heavier pills according to 
the contribution of weight to total weight.

1. Mark all bottles with numbers - 1..20 
2. Take 1 pill from bottle #1, 2 pills from bottle #2 and so on.
3. If all pills were one gram each, the total weight of pills would be - 1+2+3..20 = 20 * 21 / 2 = 210 grams
4. We know any addition to the 210 grams comes from the bottle with heavy pills.
5. For e.g. if bottle #20 was the one with heavy pills, actual weight would be: 
210 + 20 pills * 0.1 gram extra weight per pill = 212
5. So, to identify the bottle with heavier pills, we use the formula : (weight - 210) / 0.1

6.2 Basketball:
You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games.
Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots, If p is the probability of 
making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick one game or the other? 

Solution:
Let p be the probability of making a shot. probabilities of winning the games are
The probability for winning :
Game 1 = p
Game 2 = P(making all 3 shots) + P(missing only 1st shot) + 
         P(missing only 2nd shot) + P(missing only 3rd shot)
       = p^3 + 3(1-p)*p^2 = 3p^2 - 2p^3

Now, we should play the game that has a greater probability for winning.

If Game 1 has a higher chance of winning:
p >=  3p^2 - 2p^3

Solving this, we get: p < 0.5

This means: 
if probability of making a shot is less than 50%, 
    we should play Game 1 

if probability of making a shot is more than 50%, 
    we should play Game 2

if probability of making a shot is 50%, 
    we can play either of the two Games
